# User-defined script entry point

## Overview
When monitoring main-thread performance, script execution is a common source of bottlenecks.
The web platform currently provides two mechanism to monitor scripts:
- [JS Self profiling](https://wicg.github.io/js-self-profiling/)
- [Long animation frame script entry-points](https://w3c.github.io/long-animation-frames/#sec-PerformanceScriptTiming).

While self-profiling provides all the necessary information, it is highly verbose, has overhead, and is sometimes complex to analyze.
On the other hand, long animation frame scripts are "entry-points": they include the entire time span that a callback/event/script-block was run, until the microtask queue is flushed.
While this is useful in many situations, and has acceptable overhead for a field metric, there are some cases in which a script entry point is not granular enough to be useful.
For example, a framework or error reporting library can wrap all the event listeners for a web page, appearing as the "entry point" in the timeline, and the true culprit for the bottleneck would be obfuscated.

## Example of the problem

[Try It](https://loaf-wrapper-script.glitch.me/) in a browser that supports Long Animation Frames API.  Click the two buttons, open console, and compare the LoAF entry's `scripts` values.

```html
<button id="original">Original</button>
<button id="wrapper">Wrapper</button>

<script type="module">
  import original_function from "./original_function.js";
  import create_wrapper from "./some_library.js";
  
  original.addEventListener("click", original_function);
  wrapper.addEventListener("click", create_wrapper(original_function));
</script>

<script>
  const observer = new PerformanceObserver(list => {
    for (let entry of list.getEntries()) {
      console.log("LoAF", entry);
    }
  });
  observer.observe({ type: 'long-animation-frame', buffered: true });
</script>
```

Both of these buttons spend the majority of time running `original_function`, but the LoAF attribution looks quite different, depending on which button you click:

Original:
```json
{
    "name": "script",
    "entryType": "script",
    "startTime": 12345,
    "duration": 500,
    "navigationId": "d4ea7b87-5009-4f81-a55b-79ce71c01135",
    "invoker": "BUTTON#original.onclick",
    "invokerType": "event-listener",
    "windowAttribution": "self",
    "executionStart": 12345,
    "forcedStyleAndLayoutDuration": 0,
    "pauseDuration": 0,
    "sourceURL": "https://uneven-ancient-position.glitch.me/original_function.js",
    "sourceFunctionName": "original_function",
    "sourceCharPosition": 143
}
```

Wrapper:
```json
{
    "name": "script",
    "entryType": "script",
    "startTime": 12345,
    "duration": 500,
    "navigationId": "d4ea7b87-5009-4f81-a55b-79ce71c01135",
    "invoker": "BUTTON#wrapper.onclick",
    "invokerType": "event-listener",
    "windowAttribution": "self",
    "executionStart": 12345,
    "forcedStyleAndLayoutDuration": 0,
    "pauseDuration": 0,
    "sourceURL": "https://uneven-ancient-position.glitch.me/some_library.js",
    "sourceFunctionName": "wrapper_function",
    "sourceCharPosition": 85
}
```

Some differences are useful (invoker, etc), but some are not useful (sourceURL, sourceFunctionName, etc).

When reporting from field, you might conclude that `some_library.js` is slow, and miss the fact that it was `original_function`.


## Introducing user-defined entry points

### Declaring a user-defined entry point
To enable more granular insight without incurring the overhead of a sampling profiler, this proposal introduces a way for a caller of a function to declare that that function is an "entry point" for the purpose of performance monitoring.

```js
// Use in a way identical to `Function.prototype.bind`
const bound_function = performance.bind(original_function, ...prepend_arguments)

// Or give a name and additional options
const bound_function = performance.bind({
  callback: original_function,
  name: "myEventListener"
  prependArguments: []
})

// "wrapper" functions remain the default entry points
element.addEventListener("click", function unrelated_wrapper_function(e) {
  // "wrapper" functions often do some work that remains attributed to them
  doSomeWork();

  // Calling original_function() would attribute to wrapper_function()
  // But byÂ calling bound_function(), a new entry point is created
  bound_function(e);
});
```

During the execution of a performance-bound function, the time spent would be counted as part of the execution of that function, as if it was a script entry point.

### How it would appear in the performance timeline
When present, user-defined entry points would appear in the `scripts` array of a `PerformanceLongAnimationFrameTiming` entry, alongside other long scripts (>5ms).  This now means that the same portion of time may be reported to multiple scripts (i.e. creating a very simple "stack").

Because now entries can overlap in time, an attribute would be added to the script entry, `selfDuration`, which would report the duration specifically for that entry, with all nested entry durations subtracted:

```js
new PerformanceObserver(entries => {
  const entry = entries.getEntries()[0];
  const [outer_script, inner_script] = entry.scripts;

  // "event-listener"
  outer_script.invokerType;

  // "outer_function"
  entry.scripts[0].sourceFunctionName;

  // when `outer_function` was called
  entry.scripts[0].startTime;

  // The duration from `startTime` up until the moment the microtask queue was empty.
  entry.scripts[0].duration;

  // The amount of time spent in `outer_function` and its microtasks, not including bound functions.
  entry.scripts[0].selfDuration;

  // "user-bound" (*bikesheddable)
  outer_script.invokerType;

  // "inner_function"
  entry.scripts[1].sourceFunctionName;

  // when `inner_function` was called
  entry.scripts[1].startTime;

` // the duration between `startTime` and the time `inner_function` returned.
  entry.scripts[1].duration;

  // The total duration of `inner_function` including microtasks.
  entry.scripts[1].selfDuration;
}).observe({type: "long-animation-frame"});

```
It would appear in the [`scripts`](https://w3c.github.io/long-animation-frames/#dom-performancelonganimationframetiming-scripts) array of a `long-animation-frame` performance entry.


## Some details

### Overlaps
The performance timeline is not opinionated about having multiple or overlapping user-defined entry points. If multiple performance-bound functions run concurrently, they would all appear in the timeline.

However, the 5ms threshold for including scripts in the timeline still applies.  Only "long" performance-bound functions (>5ms `selfDuration`) would be included.  The `selfDuration` of all wrapper entry points would subtrack any nested entry points, even if they are not over 5ms.

### Microtasks
While executing a performance-bound function, it might queue microtasks. The time spent in those microtasks, as long as they run within the current task, are attributable to the performance-bound functions that were running at the time of queuing them.
Envision the following scenario:

```js
async function original_function() {
  await some_resolved_promise;
  do_an_app_thing();
}

const bound_function = performance.bind(original_function);

async function wrapper_function() => {
  bound_function();

  await some_other_resolved_promise;
  do_a_wrapper_thing();
};
```

In the above example, both the wrapper and the original functions would queue microtasks, which might contribute to main-thread bottlenecks.

With `performance.bind()` it is guaranteed in this case that the time spent in `do_a_wrapper_thing` would be attributed to `wrapper_function`, and the time spent in `do_an_app_thing` would be attributed to both `original_function` and `wrapper_function`.

Note that `duration` has a different meaning for default entry points than for user-defined entry points:
- For default entry points, the duration includes the time including *all* microtasks.
- For user-defined entry points, the duration is the time before the microtask checkpoint.

That's because the time spent in the inner function might not be contiguous.  Generally speaking, `duration` can help us draw the script entry on the timeline, and `selfDuration` matters more in terms of attribution.

## Alternative considered

### User timing

It is already possible to annotate *anything* using [user timing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance_API/User_timing).
However, user timing has some major drawbacks:

- It's a writable global buffer. Any script with access to the `window` object can write entries to it. So it's difficult to use it as a source of truth for attribution.
- User timing doesn't have a threshold. The user is responsible for measuring using `performance.now()` and deciding what goes into the buffer. This could lead to very wasteful buffer or processing overhead.
- There is no way (for a wrapper) to measure and attribute time outside of synchronous function call (i.e. time spent in microtasks).

### Figure out the hot functions automatically

There is no current solution for this that doesn't have overhead similar to JS self profiling.
